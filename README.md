#  Trajectory generation of winged missile with delayed wing deployment

## How do I run it? 
You may either download the files in MLX and and open stable1.mlx using Matlab. You will find the corresponding .m files in the Matlab folder. 

You may change the lift and drag coefficients file to suit your own aerofoil. The main program uses fourth order Runge Kutta method for integration between each time step.

## What does it plot?
- Trajectory
- Pitch angle vs time
- Angle of attack vs time
- Angle of velocity vector vs time
- Magnitude of velocity vs time
